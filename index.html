          <p>
            Hello, I'm Sahan Kavinda Senanayka, a 22-year-old software developer
            from Sri Lanka. I currently reside at Kanda Road, Madakumbura,
            Karandeniya.
          </p>
          <p>
            I attended G/Karandeniya Central College for my education. In terms
            of programming languages, I have experience in Java, HTML, CSS,
            Javascript, and MY SQL. I'm particularly interested in front-end
            development and have a passion for design using Figma. I am also
            currently learning new skills and techniques at IJSE to further
            improve my development abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding or learning new programming languages, I enjoy
            exploring new places and cultures through travel. I find that seeing
            new sights and meeting new people inspires me to be more creative
            and innovative in my work. Additionally, I am an avid swimmer and
            enjoy spending time in the water to stay active and energized.

          Front-End Development: As someone who is personally interested in
          front-end development, I have a passion for designing user interfaces
          and experiences using tools such as Figma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software Development: With experience in various programming
          languages, I am skilled in software development and enjoy taking on
          challenging projects that require creative solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photography, 3D Animation, and Video Editing: As hobbies, I have
          developed skills in photography, 3D animation, and video editing.
          These skills have helped me to hone my creativity and eye for detail,
          which I apply to my software development work.
