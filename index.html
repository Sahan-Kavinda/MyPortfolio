              Hello, I'm Sahan Kavinda Senanayka, a 22-year-old software
              developer from Sri Lanka. I currently reside at Kanda Road,
              Madakumbura, Karandeniya.
            </p>
            <p>
              I attended G/Karandeniya Central College for my education. In
              terms of programming languages, I have experience in Java, HTML,
              CSS, Javascript, and MY SQL. I'm particularly interested in
              front-end development and have a passion for design using Figma. I
              am also currently learning new skills and techniques at IJSE to
              further improve my development abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding or learning new programming languages, I enjoy
              exploring new places and cultures through travel. I find that
              seeing new sights and meeting new people inspires me to be more
              creative and innovative in my work. Additionally, I am an avid
              swimmer and enjoy spending time in the water to stay active and
              energized.
